FON~\cite{fon} is a global Wifi sharing network, where registered users can roam
over FON-supported Wifi networks. WLAN owners share their Wifi network either
for small money compensation, or to get Wifi access to other users when they are
way from home (roaming). FON aims at providing global Wifi sharing community
where users want to connect to others' Wifi network only because they are way
from home and have no WLAN access. Whereas in our proposal, users share Wifi
network locally (within neighbors) for better network performance. The sharing
relationship is a stable and tight loop.
