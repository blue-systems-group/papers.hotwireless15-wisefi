FON~\cite{fon} is a commercial Wifi sharing network, where registered users can
roam over FON-supported Wifi networks. WLAN owners share their Wifi network
either for small money compensation, or to get Wifi access to other users when
they are way from home (roaming). FON aims at providing global Wifi sharing
community where users want to connect to others' Wifi network because they
are way from home and have no WLAN access. 

OpenWireless movement~\cite{openwireless} is a community effort for ubiquitous
Internet access. Volunteers participate the community by configuring their
\wifi{} network with open access and a special SSID, \texttt{openwireless.org}
to advertise free access. Another goal of OpenWireless is arguably preserving user's
privacy by blending the user's network activity among all other users who share
access to the open \wifi{} network.

Both FON and OpenWireless aim at sharing \wifi{} access between strangers either
through financial incentive or volunteering. Whereas in our proposal, users share
Wifi network locally (within neighbors) for better network performance, and the
sharing relationship is immediate (between two parties) and stable (physical
neighbor relationship).
