Enabling \wifi{} sharing between neighbors both touches known open issues of
cooperative \wifi{} access and brings new challenges.

As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:sharing}, user's privacy and security can be
preserved through isolating either at network level (virtual networks) or client
level (white list vs. authenticated clients). However, it is still an open
question that whether or to what extent the user is liable to the illegal
actions, most notably copyright infringement, of the peers who share the
network.
