  Reciprocal sharing opportunities represent the cases where a group of users
  can improve their network performance by allowing each other to access their
  own private \wifi{} networks. In this paper, we investigate such opportunities
  in real life scenarios through extensive analysis of the 21 million scan
  results collected from 254 smartphones for 5 months. Inspired by the analysis
  results, we propose the design of \wisefi{}, a system that detects and enables
  reciprocal \wifi{} sharing. We discuss the challenges and open issues in
  fulfilling such a \wifi{} sharing system as \wisefi{}.
