\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we show that reciprocal \wifi{} sharing opportunities do exist in
real life scenarios through extensive analysis of the \PhoneLab{} \wifi{}
dataset. We present the design of \wisefi{}, a system that detects
reciprocal sharing opportunities, enable \wifi{} sharing and monitor the \wifi{}
usage and performance to ensure the sharing remains reciprocal.

We are currently implementing a \wisefi{} system prototype, which includes a
\wisefi{} Android application, dynamic AP configuration API support on OpenWRT
router platform, and \wisefi{} server powered by Django.
